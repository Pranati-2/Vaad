# 🧠 Vaad: AI Debater Inspired by Sanskrit Philosophical Traditions

**Vaad** is an experimental AI chatbot that emulates classical Indian styles of debate rooted in Sanskrit philosophical discourse. The project leverages cutting-edge LLMs (via the Groq API) to simulate three traditional debate forms:

- **Vāda** – truth-seeking dialogue  
- **Jalpa** – adversarial argumentation aimed at winning  
- **Vitandā** – criticism without offering counterpoints  

The ultimate vision is to develop a **context-aware, multi-agent AI system** where multiple AI personas engage in dynamic, Sanskrit-inspired debates, offering valuable insights for scholars, students, and thinkers.
